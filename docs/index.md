# Introduction

This guide aims to help you make Unified Modeling Language (UML) Class diagrams in draw.io, a free web-based diagram tool. draw.io is helpful for drawing diagrams and allows for collaborating and sharing diagrams easily. Unlike some of the other drawing tools available, you do not need an account to get started, unless you want to connect a storage account from another service such as Google to draw.io.

For more information on draw.io, see [their about page.](https://www.drawio.com/about)

## Intended Users

This guide was created to help the following people:

-   Students in BCIT's COMP 2522 Object Oriented Programming class as the style of UML diagram will be the style required in Chris Thompson's section of the course
-   People who have an understanding of UML diagrams and have little to no experience using tools to draw diagrams


## Intended Outcomes

This guide will teach you how to:

1. Create and share a diagram
2. Create UML shapes such as classes and interfaces
3. Create UML connectors

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have the following:

-   A basic understanding of UML diagrams. See [uml-diagrams.org](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/) for information.
-   A Google Drive account
-   A desktop or laptop computer as the screenshots will show the desktop layout and draw.io is intended for a desktop setup
-   Firefox as your browser

    !!!note
        If you do not use Firefox as your browser, this guide can still help you but you may see a different sequence of images. The instructions may be slightly out of order on Chrome. For example, the sharing of a diagram on Chrome will look different than Firefox.

## Conventions

Buttons will be denoted by square brackets as follows:
<span class="example">[ Button ]</span>
<br>

Verbs will be displayed in bold such as:
<span class="example">**Click** on the dotted line option</span>
<br>

A sequence of instructions to select menu items will be shown with arrows shown as **-->**:
<span class="example"> **Select** [ Menu ] --> [ New Folder ]</span>
<br>

Links to an external website will be highlighted in an accent colour:
<span class="example"> For more information on Draw.io, see [ their about page. ](https://www.drawio.com/about)</span>
<br>

To reference a specific text on a page that is not a button, it will be in _italics:_
<span class="example"> Under the _Share "Test.drawio"_, is a text field to enter an address.</span>
<br>

Optional steps will be prefaced with the word "Optional" in _italics_:
<span class="example">_Optional:_ **Click** [ Button ] for dotted connectors</span>
<br>
