# Introduction

This guide aims to help you make UML diagrams in draw.io, a free web-based diagram tool. draw.io is helpful for drawing diagrams and allows for collaborating and sharing diagrams easily. Unlike some of the other drawing tools available, you do not need an account to get started, unless you want to connect a storage account from another service such as Google to draw.io.
