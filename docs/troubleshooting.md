| The layout of Draw.io looks different and I cannot find the tools I need.        | The _Theme_ is set to Automatic or Simple when you access draw.io.                                                               | In the top right corner, **Select** [ **. . .** ] --> [ Settings ] --> [ Theme ] --> [ Classic ].                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| You can't find the   _Shapes_   panel.                                           | Sometimes it's hard to notice which menu your desired shape is in. The _Shapes_ search bar is helpful to find the shape quickly. | **Go** to the top left hand side of the screen --> **Select** the search bar for _Shapes_ --> **Type** the name of the shape --> **Hit enter** on the keyboard.                                                                                                                                                          |
| You can't find the format panel.                                                 | The format panel is hidden.                                                                                                      | **Go** to the top right hand side of the screen in the toolbar section --> **Select** the second button from the right, the [ Format ] button. Alternatively, if you're using Windows, the keyboard shortcut is:[ Ctrl ] + [ Shift ] + [ P ]. If you're on a Mac, the keyboard shortcut is: [ Cmd ] + [ Shift ] + [ P ]. |
| A section disappeared while working with others on the diagram at the same time. | When working with multiple people at the same time on a diagram, if someone tries to save, some sections may be lost.            | **Go** to the toolbar at the top left of the screen --> **Select** [ File ] --> **Select** [ Revision History ].                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| You can't access some of the text box sections within your  _Class_  shape.      | Deleting all of the text within the class shape makes the inner text boxes inaccessible.                                         | **Go** to the top left hand side of the menu --> **Select** the _Shapes_ search bar --> **Type** _Item 1_ --> Hit **Enter** on the keyboard --> **Find** [ Item 1 ] --> **Drag** [ Item 1 ] into the _Class_ with the inaccessible field. This will reintroduce an _Item_ field of the same size of the _Class_.         |

| Some elements are moving at the same time as when I move other elements.         | Your element has _relative_ instead of _absolute positioning._                                                                   | **Go** to the top left hand side of the screen -->  **Select** [ Edit ] --> **Select** [ Geometry ] --> **Uncheck** [ Relative ].                                                                                                                                                                                        |
