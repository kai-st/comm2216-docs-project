| Some elements are moving at the same time as when I move other elements.         | The  element has relative instead of absolute positioning and is bound to the element you are trying to move.                  | You can change the elements' positioning to absolute, but it will not retain it's current position. You will have to move it back afterwards.   **Select** the element you want to move independently and **Click** [ Edit ] in the _Style_ tab of the Format Panel.    **Select**  [ Edit Geometry ] and **Uncheck** the [ Relative ] checkbox.   This will make the position numbers in the _Left_ and _Top_ fields refer to distances from the top left corner of the initial page of the canvas instead of relative to the other element it was bound to. You can **Set** both the _Left_ and _Top_ position numbers to 0 to make it easier to find the element again, as it will jump once you apply the change. **Click** [ Apply ]. |
