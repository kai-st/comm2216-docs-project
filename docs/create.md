# Create and Share a draw.io File using Google Drive

Drawing diagrams using draw.io allows people to work on a diagram at the same as a team member. This tool also allows people to specify where they'd like to store their diagrams, online or locally. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will cover how to share a diagram created in draw.io and share it over Google Drive.

## Setup Storage Folder in Google Drive

If you want to specify a specific folder in Google Drive for the diagram, you'll need to create that first to be able to save it there.

!!!warning

    If you create the diagram first, then try to share it, you will not be able to specify a specific folder to store the diagram within draw.io,

1. **Go** to [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com).

2. In the top left corner, **Select** [ + New ] -> [ New Folder ].
   ![Select +New on Google Drive](./assets/newFolderA.png "Select +New on Google Drive")

   ![Name new folder](./assets/nameNewFolder.png "Name new folder")

4. **Select** [ Create ].
   ![Create new folder](./assets/createFolder.png "Create new folder")

5. _Optional_: If you want to share a folder as opposed to a single file, you can find the folder you created and **Select** the three vertical dots icon --> **Select** [ Share ] --> **Select** [ Share ].
   ![Select Dots icon, Share, and Share ](./assets/shareFolder.png "Select Dots icon, Share, and Share ")

## Share with Google Drive for Collaboration

Sharing diagrams through Google Drive allows you to work on a diagram at the same time as those you have shared it with. 

1. In the top right corner, **Select** [ Share ].
   ![Select Share](./assets/selectShare.png "Select Share")

    !!!note
        If you do not see a share button in the top right corner, you may have the _Simple_ (or _Automatic_) Theme as shown in Step 2. We recommend switching to the _Classic_ theme as it has more options listed in the toolbar. It will help you follow along this tutorial if your theme is the same as the one we display. If this doesn't apply to you, you can move on to Step 3.

2. _Optional:_ In the top right corner, **Select** [ . . . ] --> [ Settings ] --> [ Theme ] --> [ Classic ].
   ![Select the Classic theme](./assets/defaultView.png "Select the Classic theme")

3. You will receive a notification that sharing is only available through Google Drive. **Select** [ Open ] and you will be redirected to your Google Drive account.
   ![Select Open](./assets/shareViaGoogle.png "Select Open")

4. Next to the diagram we want to share, **Select** the three vertical dots --> **Select** [ Share ] --> **Select** [ Share ] again.
   ![Select Share](./assets/shareOnDrive.png "Select Share")

5. Under _Share (Your File Name)_, **Enter** the email address of the person or group you want to share the file with.

    ![Enter email and share file](./assets/shareFile.png "Enter email and share file")

6. Below _General access_ you can set the privacy options of the file. **Select** one of the following options:

    - [ Restricted ] for only the specific email addresses that the file is shared to
    - [ Anyone with the link ] for allowing access those who receive the link

    ![Select permissions](./assets/selectPermissions2.png "Select permissions")

7. On the right side of the window, there is a drop down menu that allows you to select the contributor permissions. **Select** one of the following options:

    - [ Editor ] allows making changes to the diagram
    - [ Viewer ] only permits viewing and not commenting or editing
    - [ Commenter ] allows viewing and commenting

    ![Select contributor options](./assets/selectEditor.png "Select contributor options")

8. _Optional:_ The checkbox for _Notify people_ is automatically selected. This sends an email to the email address specified earlier to share with. It's helpful so that you do not need to manually message the specified person.

9. **Select** [ Send ].

      ![Select Send](./assets/selectSend.png "Select Send")
