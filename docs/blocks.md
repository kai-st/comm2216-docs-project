# Add Classes to Your Diagram

Classes in a UML diagram are depicted as a block with the class name at the top and sections for fields, constructors, and methods below. This page will teach you how to create class blocks that look like this in draw.io:

## Add UML Shapes to Shapes Panel

The Shapes panel on the left-hand side of the screen on Draw.io has many pre-made shape templates for different kinds of diagrams, but most of them are not visible initially.

If you do not see a UML section in your Shapes panel, here is how to add it.

1. **Click** [+ More Shapes].

   This will open the Shapes selection box.

   You should now see the UML shape set in the Shapes panel.

6. **Click** the UML heading to expand the shape set.
