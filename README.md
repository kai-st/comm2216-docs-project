# draw.io User Documentation Project

## About

This is a tutorial for those who have a familiarity with UML diagrams and want to learn how make them in [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). draw.io is a free web-based diagram tool that allows users to share and collaborate on diagrams at the same time. This tutorial is intended for people using Mozilla Firefox as their browser as the steps can appear differently on Google Chrome. We made this documentation to serve as a guide for other students and as an exercise in building helpful user documentation.

## Tools Used

-   We used [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) as the backbone to create our documentation for its professional layout.

-   We followed the instructions in [Squidfunk's Material for MKDocs guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).

-   We completed this [this Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/) to gain experience typing in Markdown. We referenced this [Makrdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) as a guide.

-   Pearly used [Preview](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/preview/welcome/mac) to add annotations to our screenshots for the instructions.

-   Kai used [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) to capture gifs of our instructions in action.

## Method and processes

To create clear and concise documentation, we provide screenshots with annotations and animated gifs for concrete examples to guide the reader. We went through each step to ensure our instructions were consistent and to provide a visual example along the way. We used private windows in Firefox to ensure that the visual examples represent a first time user's experience.
